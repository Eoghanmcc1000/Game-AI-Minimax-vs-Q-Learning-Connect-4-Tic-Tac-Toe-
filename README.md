# Game-AI-Minimax-vs-Q-Learning-Connect-4-Tic-Tac-Toe-
This project implements classical search algorithms (Minimax with and without Alpha-Beta pruning) and Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) for two games: Connect 4 and Tic-Tac-Toe. The implementations are benchmarked on win rates, computational efficiency, and scalability.
